## What upgraded from V1 -> V2 ?

There were some fixes to the nftMarketplace as well as NFT contract not keeping correct state about NFTs if maliciously used.

The NFT Marketplace is currently running and fully functional on Goerli at

1. NFT Market:

2. NFT:

The Website is online and running atÂ [Website](https://fluffy-moonbeam-06ab85.netlify.app/)

## Local environment set up

1. git clone

2. npm i

3. npm start

4. npx hardhat console --network goerli

5. npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli

6. const contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("NftMarketPlaceV2")

7. const Contract = await contract.attach("[input address from deploying NftMarketPlaceV2 contract (step 5)]")

8. await Contract.setNftAddress("[input address from NFTV2 contract (step 5)]")

## Video Demo

## Approach

Running currently on Goerli
A NFT Marketplace running currently on Goerli. Let's you mint, sell and buy NFT's. During the minting we store the Metadata on IPFS and only store the TokenURI on-chain.

### Gasless Transactions

This NFT allows party gasless NFT minting,selling and buying (mintNFT(), sellNFT(), buyNFT()) thanks to biconomy (only the marketplace itself and not NFT contract is currently gasless, because of the nature of my contract setup only the second transaction you need to accept for minting, etc... will be gasless (you still have to pay 0.002 eth fee to the contract to the owner when minting))
