A NFT Marketplace running currently on Rinkeby. Let's you mint, sell and buy NFT's. During the minting we store the Metadata on IPFS and only store the TokenURI on-chain.

### Gasless Transactions

This NFT allows party gasless NFT minting,selling and buying (mintNFT(), sellNFT(), buyNFT()) thanks to biconomy (only the marketplace itself and not NFT contract is currently gasless, because of the nature of my contract setup only the second transaction you need to accept for minting, etc... will be gasless (you still have to pay 0.002 eth fee to the contract to the owner when minting))
